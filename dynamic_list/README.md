I have no idea what does `Should return the position when other item is hovered` mean. Therefore I made division named `currentHoveredItem` to keep track of what is hovered right now.

It says it should be avoided to use CSS for user interaction. So I use CSS only as setting width, height, position or somehting else except interaction things.
